<h2>THE MASCOT OF SWEET BRIAR GULCH</h2>
</div>

<p>The gulch ran in a trough of
beauty to the foot of Jones&#8217;s
Hill, which rose in a sweeping curve
into the clouds.
</p>
<p>Wild flowers, trees in profuse leaf,
and mats of vines covered the scarred
earth, and the sky was as limpid as
spring water; the air carried a weight
of heart-stirring odors, yet Jim Felton,
sitting on the door-step of his cabin in
the brilliant sunshine, was not a happy
man.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>He looked at the hollow of the gulch
and cursed it manfully and bitterly.
The gold should be there&mdash;Jim had
figured it all out. The old wash cut at
right angles to the creek, and at the
turn was where its freight of yellow
metal should have been deposited, but
when you got down to the bed-rock, the
blasted stuff was either slanted so nothing
could stay on it, or was rotten&mdash;crumbling
in your fingers, and that
kind of bed will hold nothing.
</p>
<p>Therefore Jim had sunk about fifty
prospect holes; got colors under the
grass-roots, as evidence that pay should
be there&mdash;and nothing but ashy wash
beneath it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>When a man is alone, and thinks
things are wrong, optimism comes
down on the run, the shades of pessimism
gather fast and furious&mdash;more
especially if a man does his own cooking,
and the raw material is limited, at
that.
</p>
<p>The sun had not moved the shadows
three inches before Jim had reached
the conclusion that this world was all
a practical joke, of so low an order that
no sensible man would even laugh at it,
and he drew a letter from his pocket
in proof thereof. It was a thin letter,
written on delicate paper in a delicate
hand, and it showed much wear. He
read for the thousandth time:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dearest Jim</span>&mdash;And again I must
say &#8220;no.&#8221; Of course you will not understand,
for which foolish reason I
like you all the better, but you must try
to take my point of view. You say that
we can be married on nothing and take
our chances.
</p>
<p>So we can, old simple-heart&mdash;but
aren&#8217;t those chances all against us?
Would you like to be forced to work in
some office for just enough to live on?
You know you would not, and you
know how you would suffer in such
slavery.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless we can not live on air,
and I doubt if I would stand transplanting
to the wild life you love, better than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
you to a clerk&#8217;s desk. You have that
fancy which gilds the tin cans in the
back yard; I have that unfortunate eye
which would multiply their number by
three, and their unsightliness by ten.
I don&#8217;t want riches, dear; I only want
a modest assurance that I can have
enough to live on.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>Really, is your way of doing a guarantee
of even bread and butter? In the
Garden of Eden you would be the most
delightful of companions, but in this
world as it is, you will not fight for your
own. You would risk your life to save
a dog, but you couldn&#8217;t stay at a continued
grind&mdash;I mean it would kill
you, actually, physically, dead, dead&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
save all of us. At first I thought that
a fault in you, but now, being older,
having compared you to other men, I
see it is merely a missing faculty.
</p>
<p>I could stick to the desk, and would
gladly, if you would let me, yet I could
not even fancy behaving as you did at
the factory fire, which is still the symbol
in the town for manly courage and
presence of mind.
</p>
<p>They talk now of the way you
laughed and joked with those poor
frightened girls (who had such good
cause to be frightened) and brought
them back to sanity with a jest. I feel
that if I had the least atom of heroism
in me I would marry you for that feat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
alone, and let cold facts go hang; but,
ah, Jim! magnificent as you are on the
grand occasions, they come but seldom,
and in the meantime, Jim&mdash;I&#8217;ll leave
that to your own honesty.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m plebeian, Jim, and you&#8217;re a
nobleman, with a beautiful but embarrassing
disregard for vulgar necessities.
</p>
<p>However, I can say this for myself&mdash;for
surely I may brag a little to my
lover&mdash;I can try to match your splendid
physical bravery by my own moral
courage.
</p>
<p>You may rest your soul in peace on
one point. If I am not for you, I&#8217;m for
no man, no, not so much as a half-glance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
of the eye. I wouldn&#8217;t hold myself
a bit more straitly if I were your
wife.
</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be angry at this letter. Well,
I&#8217;ll stand your anger. I have caused it,
and I&#8217;ll bear the blame. I know that
we could not be happy without some
visible means of support, yet I do not
blame you in the least for thinking
otherwise.
</p>
<p>Be as kind to me as you can, Jim,
for I love you very much in my commonplace
way. I&#8217;ll admit, too, that I
had rather have your fire than my refrigerator&mdash;oh,
if you could only make
some money&mdash;not a great deal, but
enough for a little house of our own,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and enough in the bank to buy groceries!
</p>
<p>With my best love, and an aching
lump in my throat,
</p>
<p>Your mother, sister, and sweetheart,
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Anne</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Jim dropped the letter, and his lips
trembled a little. Parts of it touched
him deeply, and he was the more enraged
and hurt at the rest because of
that.
</p>
<p>He could not call her mercenary.
He knew better. More than one very
comfortable income was at her disposal.
</p>
<p>Poor fellow! He could only grind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
his teeth and curse Sweet Briar gulch
from the deepest pot-hole in the bed-rock
to the top of its loftiest pine.
He drew out her photograph, and obtained
much sweet consolation by
thinking how happy they two would
be in Sweet Briar gulch together, even
if there wasn&#8217;t a cent of pay in the
gravel.
</p>
<p>Sick of this ingenious torture, he
lit his pipe and drew savagely upon
it. With a mocking gurgle, about a
dram of &#8220;slumgullion&#8221; passed into
his mouth. It was the last touch. He
spat out the biting, nauseating stuff,
hurled the pipe upon the rocks and
danced on it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>And yet the colors frolicked in the
gulch; the pines toned the air with
healthy breath.
</p>
<p>From afar came the th-r-r-up!
th-r-r-up! th-r-r-up of a galloping
horse. It was Bud, the mail-carrier,
coming, modestly and quietly, at a decent
gait, down a trail where most
would prefer to walk, and to &#8220;hang on&#8221;
to something at that.
</p>
<p>At first Jim felt irritated by the interruption.
He wanted to luxuriate in
misery: still he was a vigorous, healthy
man, and the cheery good-fellowship
of Bud soon made away with that feeling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how they coming, Jimmy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
queried the young giant. &#8220;Hit her
yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit&mdash;well, much caloric,&#8221;&mdash;replied
Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;ve begun to believe there
ain&#8217;t a durned thing here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking kind of owly, old
man&mdash;what&#8217;s up? Don&#8217;t you feel
well?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bud I I&#8217;m sick of everything
this day&mdash;I don&#8217;t believe in the constitution
of the United States, including
the thirteenth amendment, nor the ten
commandments, nor the attraction of
gravitation, nor anything else&mdash;it&#8217;s all
a damned lie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No wonder you get like that, mousing
around here without a chance to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
yappi with a feller critter. &#8217;Nough to
make you locoed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump it for a spell. Go up town.
Get loaded. Get horribly loaded.
Break somebody&#8217;s window, and tell the
folks you&#8217;re a Sweet Briar zephyr come
to blow out their lights. Go ahead and
do it. When your hair stops pulling
you&#8217;ll feel like a new man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim thought the advice sound, yet a
strange feeling had developed in him,
in his isolation; it was that the eye of
Anne was always on him. He had
fallen into a habit, which becomes a superstition
when a man is alone, of acting
as though she were there in person.
</p>
<p>However, he didn&#8217;t feel called upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
to offer Bud that explanation of his refusal.
He conveyed the idea in one
brief word.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Busted,&#8221; said he.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Busted?&#8221; retorted Bud warmly.
&#8220;Busted? Not much, you ain&#8217;t busted
whilst that little package is there, bet
cher life! You call for what you want,
and the cashier will make good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Bud! How&#8217;ll I ever pay you
back? Keep it, man, keep it,&#8221; replied
Jim in a disheartened voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you ain&#8217;t got no call to worry
about that part of it&mdash;there&#8217;s where my
troubles begin,&#8221; returned Bud. &#8220;Now,
you take these two bucks and jab &#8217;em in
your jeans&mdash;Go on, now! Do as I tell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
you, or damned if I don&#8217;t lick you and
make you take &#8217;em! What&#8217;s the good
of money if it ain&#8217;t to help a friend out
with? I don&#8217;t care who gets drunk on
it, just so long as they have a good time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Boy, you&#8217;ll be sailing up the track
regardless of orders, with your boiler
full of suds, if you don&#8217;t get out in the
scramble for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! I&#8217;d like to see a railroad
train! Haven&#8217;t heard a whistle for two
years! How far is it to the nearest station,
Bud?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plattsburg&mdash;fifty mile&mdash;due
south.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Christmas! Little far to walk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you take this horse, Jim,&mdash;go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
ahead! I can walk just as well as not,
I&#8217;m getting too fat, anyhow. Go on,
you take the horse and have a ride to
Plattsburg!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, take the shirt off your back,
and never mind if a bit of the skin goes
with it. I&#8217;ll see you far away first. Tell
you what you could do for me, Buddy;
the herd of burros is around now, if
you&#8217;d round up one of them for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing! You sit on the mail
sack till I come back. There&#8217;s a heap
of registered stuff in it this trip. Oh
say! What do you think? I was held
up t&#8217;other side of the Bulldog. Bang!
Zipp! says a little popper from the
bushes. I climbed for them bushes, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
out goes a beggar like a rabbit. I was
after him like a coyote, bet cher life.
Who do you suppose it was, Jim?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it, how should I know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That little down-east cuss with the
crook in his back. He begged hard.
Poor devil, he was up against the sandpaper
side, all right. He heard from
the postmaster that there was a lot of
valuable mail going out, so he thought
he&#8217;d make a try for it. Then what do
you think he had the cold, cold nerve
to do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass it up&mdash;&#8217;most anything, I
reckon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse&#8217;n that. Struck me for fifty!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And got it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Got it? No, not much he didn&#8217;t,
sonny! He drew just ten, and he was
lucky to get that. I&#8217;ve done a favor or
two for that feller, first and last, and
to have him shoot at me made me sore&mdash;although
he missed me by several locations,
I&#8217;ll say that for him&mdash;so I gave
him the ten and told him I&#8217;d kick the
hump on his back so high up on his
shoulders he could wear it for a hat,
if he ever shoved into my daylight
again. And you never in your life saw
a humpback make better time than he
did.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well here&#8217;s for your jack-ass&mdash;which
way&#8217;s the herd?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right up over the hill.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>Jim sat patiently on the sack until
Bud returned with the burro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your thoroughbred!&#8221; holloed
Bud. &#8220;Get ap, there, Mary. Look
at the knowing ears of him, will you?
You bet cher life, you&#8217;ve got an animile
there that&#8217;ll go when he gets ready, and
as fast as he pretty well damn pleases&mdash;nail
him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim tied a gunny sack on his noble
mount, and the two rode on together to
the fork in the trail. Jim tried to thank
his friend, who knocked his hat over
his eyes, and said, &#8220;Aw, write it down
when you&#8217;ve got more time. Never see
a feller in my life I cottoned to more&#8217;n
you, Jim. First I thought you was too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
smooth for my kind of traveling, but
later, I see it was only the grain of the
wood. I believe in my friends, I do.
Here we go hopping around this little
world for a small time, and then that&#8217;s
done. S&#8217;pose you ain&#8217;t got any real
friends for the trip? Rotten, I say.
You go ahead and rip Plattsburg up
the back. Wisht I could be there with
you. Don&#8217;t you mind consequences. So
long, old man! Hike! You beggar!&#8221;
The buckskin pony was off with a snort
and a splashing of gravel as the irons
touched his sides, and Bud vanished
down the road without a look behind
him.
</p>
<p>The next day Jim was in Plattsburg.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
One does not know what an alluring
quality, what a hazy enchantment can
linger around even a small town, until
an absence in a real wilderness has
given man&#8217;s work a new flavor.
</p>
<p>The people coming and going, the
traffic of the stores, the dwellings with
small cultivated plots around them
warmed Jim like a fire. He had been
very lonely, without knowing it. In the
afternoon he went down to the depot to
see the eastern train come in.
</p>
<p>Here again absence played a part,
and restored the locomotive to its
proper proportions of a miracle.
</p>
<p>As the engine glided in, shaking the
ground beneath it, it seemed impossible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
to Jim that man really made it. What!
Bend those mighty rods of steel to his
will? Twist and shape those others?
Cast those great drivers? And after,
to drive the monster with a hand?
</p>
<p>He drew back as the buzzing engine
passed him, with something like awe.
Then the moving village came to a stop
and the passengers sallied forth to test
their legs, wearied with long sitting.
</p>
<p>There was humanity of all shades,
from the haughty aristocrat of the
Pullman, to the peasant of the immigrant
car.
</p>
<p>Jim had a sense of pleasure in beholding
well-dressed folk again; yet it
was merely an æsthetic pleasure, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
he found, when he began to speculate
on the possibilities of the throng before
him, that he was more interested
in those whose all was staked on the
trip, than in those to whom it was only
an excursion.
</p>
<p>People of widely differing nationalities
occupied the immigrant car. Jim
wondered whether they would ever become
Americans, according to his
ideas of Americans, a people in which
he had great pride and delight; and
he shook his head doubtfully as he took
them in.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a small boy darted out of
a car; an exceedingly small boy, thin to
emaciation, who made his way through
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
the crowd with that sprawling, active,
dancing manner peculiar to thin small
boys and spiders.
</p>
<p>Jim half laughed at the little chap
until he saw his face; then he realized
at a glance that the matter was no
laughing one for the boy.
</p>
<p>At the same time he saw the shocking
thinness of the little face, made into a
wolf&#8217;s face by hunger; the mingled
horror and desperation of the eyes; the
big man would not have believed a
child&#8217;s face could express emotions of
such magnitude. He was wonder-stricken
at the sight, and felt an instinctive
sympathy for the fugitive.
</p>
<p>It is a strange thing how fortune will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
sometimes guide with certainty, when
reason shows no path.
</p>
<p>The boy came unerringly toward
Jim; Jim had a sort of prophetic insight
that he would. Back behind him
the urchin ran. &#8220;Don&#8217;t cher give me
away, Mister!&#8221; he pleaded. Jim
flapped a hand in answer.
</p>
<p>At the time he was leaning against
a corner of the station; a little back of
him was a small lean-to shed where
various truck was stored.
</p>
<p>Out of the car came a burly brute of
a man, who stared about him rapidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s der ol&#8217; man,&#8221; whispered the
boy. &#8220;If he gits holt of me, there won&#8217;t
be a hull bone left in me body.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>The man walked up to the conductor
and spoke to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aggh!&#8221; said the boy. &#8220;Now dey&#8217;ll
get me sure&mdash;der jig is up&mdash;dey&#8217;ll have
der hull gang ertop o&#8217; me!&#8221; the voice
trailed off into a strangled sob, and
then continued in a fierce whisper:
&#8220;Aggh! If I had me growth, I&#8217;d show
&#8217;em! I&#8217;d show &#8217;em!&#8221; and then a burst
of hair-raising profanity.
</p>
<p>The argument was growing loud between
the man, who was urging something,
and the conductor, who was declining;
others were walking toward
the moderate excitement.
</p>
<p>Jim wheeled and caught the boy in
his arms. &#8220;Up you go!&#8221; he said, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
tossed him on top of the shed. &#8220;Lie
low behind the wood there, and you are
all right.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-026.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>Then came the conductor&#8217;s voice:
&#8220;Say, my friend, if you think I&#8217;m going
to hold my train while you hunt up a
lost kid, there&#8217;s something in you that
don&#8217;t work right! Why didn&#8217;t you take
care of him while you had him? Now
you&#8217;ve got just four minutes by the
watch; either hustle around and hunt,
or drop off the train and hunt&mdash;what&#8217;s
that? Now don&#8217;t you give me any
slack, you black-muzzled tarrier, or
I&#8217;ll have the fear of God thrown into
you too quick. Get out of here now!
Get out of my way!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>The man slouched off, and made a
hasty search around the station. A
woman&#8217;s face&mdash;scarcely an improvement
on the man&#8217;s&mdash;leaned out of the
car window and jeered at the hunter,
who cursed her back savagely.
</p>
<p>The man walked up to Jim. &#8220;Say,
did yer see a kid go by here, Mister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a shrug of his shoulders, Jim
asked him that question in Mr. Ollendorf&#8217;s
French method, about the pink-and-green
overcoat of the shoemaker&#8217;s
wife&#8217;s sister.
</p>
<p>The man showered low abuse on
what he supposed was a foreigner, until
Jim&#8217;s ribs rose with the desire to kill
him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ayr, wot are yer wastin&#8217; time wid
th&#8217; Dago fur?&#8221; called the woman.
&#8220;Th&#8217; kid&#8217;s on the roof!&#8221; Jim&#8217;s heart
almost stopped, so thoroughly had he
identified himself with this quarrel.
He made up his mind to fight for the
boy, right or wrong.
</p>
<p>But he was saved the trouble. It was
only a jest of the woman&#8217;s, for she suddenly
called, so earnestly that even Jim
was fooled. &#8220;No he ain&#8217;t neither; I
see him! I see him! There he is.&#8221; It
was the perfection of acting, voice and
gesture.
</p>
<p>The man ran out to see where she was
pointing. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221; he asked,
looking wildly around.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;On top der flag-pole, like er monkey!
You&#8217;re it!&#8221; she cried, with a
shriek of laughter at the black brows of
her dupe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show yer der joke, when I git
in dere!&#8221; he threatened.
</p>
<p>The woman leaned her chin on her
hands and smiled. Jim never forgot
the utter undauntedness, impudence
and malice of that face. &#8220;Yer allus
goin&#8217; to do sumpin&#8217;, Pete!&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;Yer&#8217;ll be a man yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A more amiable man than &#8220;Pete&#8221;
might have been provoked by such conduct.
He strode forward with white-knuckled
fists and a very unpleasant
expression on his face. Several men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
started to interfere, but it wasn&#8217;t necessary.
</p>
<p>The woman quietly looked at her
bully, chewing a straw with the utmost
nonchalance. &#8220;Give us a kiss,&#8221; said she.
The man&#8217;s crest dropped. He said
something in an undertone, and got on
the car.
</p>
<p>Jim needed no further knowledge of
this delightful couple to be thoroughly
on the boy&#8217;s side. It seemed to him that
the man was quite capable of keeping
a small animal at hand, for the fun of
torturing it, and as for the woman&mdash;well,
if there was her like in hell, Jim
determined to be good for the rest of
his days.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; cried the conductor,
and with a few mighty breaths the iron
giant whisked its load out in the open
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay where you are, son, till I see
whether that fellow is playing a trick,&#8221;
said Jim, and not until he had looked
under the platform, up and down the
track, and in the waiting rooms, did he
give the command, &#8220;Come down!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
<h2>II</h2>
</div>

<p>The passenger agent saw the performance
with astonishment.
&#8220;So you had the boy tucked away all
the time?&#8221; said he. &#8220;Just what kind of
a game is this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunno,&#8221; returned Jim. &#8220;Let the
boy speak for himself. Now, young
man, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The urchin stood before them, taking
them in thoroughly with his sharp
little eyes. More big men strolled up.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
As a particularly fine foil to the boy&#8217;s
diminutive form, Benny, the baggage
smasher, whose overhanging shoulders
testified whence came the power that
had reduced many a proud Saratoga to
elemental conditions, and &#8220;Happy
Jack,&#8221; the mammoth, soot-black, loose-jointed
negro porter, placed themselves
on either side of him. They
made the boy look more like an insect
than ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wot&#8217;s de matter?&#8221; he cried in a
voice at once hoarse and shrill, with a
cursing note in it, and accompanying
the words with an extravagant, dramatic
gesture of his skinny claw. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
tell yer wot&#8217;s der matter&mdash;dey beat me&mdash;dey
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
beat me bad. I don&#8217;t ast youse
to take me word fur it&mdash;look at me
back&mdash;dat&#8217;s all I ast yer&mdash;jes&#8217; look at
dat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He ripped the shirt from his shoulders.
An angry growl went up from
all those big-bearded men when they
saw the horrible stripes and welts&mdash;raw,
blue and swollen&mdash;on the poor
little back.
</p>
<p>Happy Jack threw up both his
gorilla arms. &#8220;Lord Jesus! Who done
you like dat, boy?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;&#8217;F I got
m&#8217; hookers on him, cuss me &#8217;f I wudden&#8217;
put bumps on him bigger&#8217;n yer
hull body.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now yer talkin&#8217;,&#8221; shrieked the boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
He raised himself to the tips of his toes,
bared his teeth to the gum, and with
clutching talons, gripping at the air,
yelled: &#8220;Aggh! If I had me growth!
I&#8217;d bite his heart out! I&#8217;d tear his neck
for &#8217;im!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men looked astounded on this
mighty fury, pent in so small and miserable
a cage. The voice had a peculiar
alarming call to it, like the note
of a fire-gong.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy&#8217;s head dropped on
the crook of his arm. &#8220;Treated me
wuss&#8217;n a dog,&#8221; he sobbed out. &#8220;Done
me so it makes even dat nigger holler
when he sees it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Happy Jack was taken aback. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
other men smoothed down their faces
forcibly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, lil&#8217; boy, you think dat&#8217;s a p&#8217;lite
way to talk to people?&#8221; inquired Jack.
</p>
<p>The boy wiped his eyes on his sleeve
and went over to him. &#8220;Say, don&#8217;t yer
holt nothin&#8217; ag&#8217;in me fur der word,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;Dey&#8217;ve got me looney&mdash;dat&#8217;s
wot&mdash;yer&#8217;ve used me liker fren&#8217;; and
if it hoits yer, yer can kick me pants fur
me, and I won&#8217;t say nuthin&#8217;.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s two-pound-and-a-half
of dead game sport for you, all right!&#8221;
cried Benny. &#8220;Good eye, kid!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Happy Jack smiled a mollified smile
eight inches wide. &#8220;You is all right,
beau,&#8221; said he. &#8220;An&#8217; as fur as my bein&#8217;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
a nigger&#8217;s concerned, I&#8217;ll admit my
kerplection ain&#8217;t light.&#8221; He slapped
his ham and brought down a foot on
the platform. &#8220;Hyah, hyah!&#8221; he
roared, &#8220;you bet dere ain&#8217;t no dam&#8217;
blond &#8217;bout me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The infectious darky laugh started
the others off, and brought matters to a
common-sense footing.
</p>
<p>The passenger agent took up the interrogation.
Was the man the boy&#8217;s
real father? Answer: &#8220;How&#8217;d I know?
Dat&#8217;s der song he guv me.&#8221; Were
there any relatives? Friends? Answer:
&#8220;Naw!&#8221; Well, what did the boy propose
to do? Answer, digging his toes
into the boards: &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know&mdash;anyt&#8217;ing!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
What was his name? &#8220;Jim.&#8221;
Jim what? &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know. Sometimes
der gun callt himself &#8216;Darragh,&#8217; an&#8217;
sometimes &#8216;Mullen,&#8217; an&#8217; sometimes
&#8216;Smit.&#8217; Aggh! He callt himself the
foist t&#8217;ing dat come to his tongue&mdash;he
didn&#8217;t have no real name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The agent talked to him a bit more,
winding up by saying kindly: &#8220;You&#8217;ve
had a pretty rough time of it, Jimmy,
and we&#8217;d all like to give you a lift&mdash;now,
just say what you&#8217;d like to do,
and maybe we can fix it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go along wid dat feller,
&#8217;f he&#8217;ll take me,&#8221; replied the boy, tossing
a thumb toward Jim Felton. There
was a becoming access of shyness in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
manner; moreover, Felton had an increased
interest in him when he knew
they bore the same name&mdash;a sort of
kinship, as it were.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s up to you, Mister&mdash;&#8221; said
the passenger agent, with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Felton,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;m in. I&#8217;ll
take the boy. Hard rustling down my
way, but I guess we can make out somehow.
Sure you want to go, kid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yessir!&#8221; very heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Done, then!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Happy Jack snatched off his uniform
cap, spat on a bill, and flapped it into
the bottom thereof.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, fren&#8217;!&#8221; said he. He shook
the cap in front of the others. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
fur the lil&#8217; rooster; step up to the capen&#8217;s
office an&#8217; settle, gents!&#8221; he called.
&#8220;&#8217;Member what de Bible says, &#8216;Fool
an&#8217; his money soon parted.&#8217; Come up!
Come up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They came up generously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick a five in there for me, Bill,&#8221;
said Benny to the passenger agent,
&#8220;I&#8217;m strapped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much you got, boy?&#8221; asked
the agent, as Happy counted the
money.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fo&#8217;ty dollars, even money, Misto&#8217;
Breckenridge.&#8221; The agent was a bachelor
with a fat salary. &#8220;Here, that
makes it fifty,&#8221; said he. He turned to
Felton. &#8220;Now, what do you say if we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
go across the street and&mdash;er&mdash;discuss
this matter a little further?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go you,&#8221; replied Felton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Jimmy, you sit here for a moment.
We&#8217;re going on some business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy glanced at them sharply.
&#8220;Youse fellers is goin&#8217; to get a drink,&#8221;
said he.
</p>
<p>Those big men put their hands on
their sides and roared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find that kid worse than a
wife, Felton!&#8221; said the agent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No use of our being hypocrites to
the little chap. I reckon he&#8217;s seen
worse things than the inside of a saloon.
Come along, laddybuck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They lined up and partook. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
agent told the story of the waif. &#8220;And
we started him off with fifty, Mac,&#8221; he
said to the saloon-keeper. &#8220;Suppose
you break away from some of your ill-gotten
gains in the good cause.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The saloon-keeper opened his cash
drawer without words and slid over a
five-dollar bill. He seemed very glad
to part with it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound it! Now we&#8217;re upsticks
again,&#8221; said the agent. &#8220;Tell you what
let&#8217;s do. Here&#8217;s ten of us. Each man
put up a two, and we&#8217;ll shake the dice
to see who gives it to the kid&mdash;winner
to set &#8217;em up. That&#8217;ll make seventy-five&mdash;a
very respectable figure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They played a new interesting dice-game,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
in which the figure of a pig
drawn in chalk upon the bar furnished
the &#8220;lay-out.&#8221; It is a game which increases
in interest to the last throw.
They stuck the saloon-keeper, and were
gleeful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to name the boy,&#8221; said
Felton, under the inspiration of the second
refreshment. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Jim,
and I want something else to call him
by. I&#8217;ll make him a present of my last
name.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad, that&#8217;s so!&#8221; replied the agent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call him Chescheela Jim,&#8221; put in a
cow-man. &#8220;That&#8217;s Injun for &#8216;little
Jim.&#8217; &#8216;Ches&#8217; ain&#8217;t a bad nickname.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<span class='caption'>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Mac, hand over one of those toy
sample bottles of California fizz,&#8221; said
the agent. &#8220;We&#8217;ll put this craft down
the ways in shape.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Felton broke the neck off the bottle
with a tack-hammer and poured the
wine on the boy&#8217;s head. &#8220;I christen
thee Chescheela James Felton&mdash;may
you become a good seaworthy craft,
and not fill your skin with this stuff
when you grow up,&#8221; said he dramatically.
</p>
<p>The small boy squinted up his eyes
to keep the wine out; then he shook the
liquid from his hair, looked up and
grinned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Youse fellers is reg&#8217;lar kids,&#8221; said
he.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, that&#8217;s a great boy!&#8221; said the
agent. &#8220;He&#8217;s the oldest man in the
crowd. Say, let&#8217;s give him a white
man&#8217;s start, beginning with a bath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The whole party went to the barbershop
and made the darky proprietor
dispense a bath and a hair-cut for nothing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shave, sir?&#8221; asked the latter, when
the hair had been properly trimmed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the youth. &#8220;I t&#8217;ink
I&#8217;ll let me whiskers grow. Dere&#8217;s enuff
wind in dis country ter keep der moths
outen &#8217;em.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then they raided the clothing store,
and abused the Hebrew owner until he
reduced the price. &#8220;Oof der
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
lodt&mdash;everyding, shennelmun! Sigsdy ber
zent. Dere&#8217;s no broffit left&mdash;it doaned
bay fur the freight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Sol! Will you swear
that on a piece of pork?&#8221; demanded the
agent. The Hebrew moaned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doaned dalk to me!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;My
heardt iss prooken!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clean, trimmed and clothed, Chescheela
James Felton was a different
looking boy. Months only could take
those animal lines out of his face, and
fresh air and wholesome food fill out
the hollows of the cheeks, but, all in
all, he was not a bad-looking youngster.
</p>
<p>Jim Felton bought some supplies for
his camp, and prepared to start for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
home that afternoon, as they could yet
make fifteen miles before dark.
</p>
<p>The new friends of the morning saw
them off with hearty good-bys. The
boy quite unexpectedly thanked them
for their treatment and the money. The
poor little soul had heard few words of
gratitude, and had less chance to employ
them.
</p>
<p>His speech was curious, but the generous
big men saw behind the words,
and felt really touched by the old-child&#8217;s
attempt to express himself.
</p>
<p>The two Jims soon pushed on,
through the rolling foot-hills near the
town, into the broken country. The
boy kept watching, watching, but said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
little, until at last they came to the stupendous
cliffs of Paha-Sahpedon, overhanging
the trail with dark majesty.
Jim happened to glance at the boy, and
saw him looking up, mouth and eyes
wide open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister!&#8221; gasped Ches. &#8220;Who
built them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Built?&#8221; repeated Jim, puzzled.
Then he understood. &#8220;The hand of
God, my boy,&#8221; he replied.
</p>
<p>The urchin shivered. &#8220;I feel&#8217;s if
dey was comin&#8217; ertop o&#8217; me,&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hook it outer here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim spanked the burro, and they flew
out of the Paha-Sahpedon at a canter.
</p>
<p>They camped that night in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
spruces of Silver Creek, in one of the
prettiest little places that ever lay out
of doors. As they prepared the supper
and ate it, sharing plate, cup and spoon,
the boy was fairly ecstatic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dis is der bulliest ol&#8217; time dat ever I
had,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know dere
was places like dis &#8217;tall, &#8217;cept Cintral
Park. Yer can run aroun&#8217; here all yer
like, can&#8217;t yer, Mister? Nobuddy&#8217;ll
stop yer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if you ran a thousand miles,
Ches. This is the free land, boy. You
can do what you like.&#8221; Jim spoke with
warmth, for, although he felt that the
child could not understand, yet the love
of the country swelled in him so hot
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
that he could never speak of it carelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s prutty damn good,&#8221; responded
Ches.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; replied Jim. &#8220;Now, Ches,
will you do something to oblige me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, don&#8217;t swear. I don&#8217;t
like to hear boys swear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t cuss another cuss, if I kin
help it. Dey&#8217;ll come out too quick for
me sometimes, but I&#8217;ll try to do dat,
now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Now, let&#8217;s get the stuff
cleared up and roll in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the middle of the night Jim heard
a strange noise, a puzzling sound he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
could not trace. Becoming wider
awake, it resolved itself into a stifled
weeping.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there, Ches! What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
he cried.
</p>
<p>The boy flung himself into Jim&#8217;s
arms with a cry. &#8220;Ar, I&#8217;m scart to
deat&#8217;,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Take holt uf me, Mister!
Take holt uf me! Dere ain&#8217;t anyt&#8217;ing
but you and me here &#8217;tall!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim gathered up the trembling
figure. &#8220;Nothing will hurt you, Ches,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re safe here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t t&#8217;inkin&#8217; of gettin&#8217; hurted,&#8221;
retorted the boy, with shaky indignation.
&#8220;Did youse t&#8217;ink I&#8217;d weaken fur
dat? Yer don&#8217;t know me, den. Dat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
ain&#8217;t bodderin&#8217; me&mdash;I&#8217;ve been hurted
plenty. I&#8217;m just scart, dat&#8217;s wat&#8217;s der
matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, you cuddle right up in
my arms, like a little puppy dog, and
you&#8217;ll feel all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re prutty good stuff, Mister
Felton,&#8221; whimpered the little voice.
&#8220;Dis is der bulliest time I ever had,
even if I am scart.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re a brave boy, Ches.
Now go to sleep.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A small hand reached timidly
around until it found the man&#8217;s and
gave it an affectionate squeeze. &#8220;Good
night, sir,&#8221; said Ches.
</p>
<p>Jim lay awake, thinking dreamily,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
long after the boy&#8217;s regular breathing
showed that he was at peace again.
The man felt a tenderness for the waif
so abruptly put in his care that only a
lonely man can feel. He speculated
about the boy&#8217;s future; he wondered
what kind of a man he would make.
Surely, with a foundation of such courage,
the better part could be brought
out.
</p>
<p>Then he wondered what Anne
would say to the adoption, or rather
what advice she would give, for he felt
entirely sure of her broad humanity,
outside of their one difference. He felt
the need of her practical sense. Soon he
had drifted into thinking of Anne entirely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Not bitterly now, but with a
steady longing. The gray light of the
waning moon, sifting through the
boughs, was the true lumina for reverie.
Why had he not answered her letter?
Perhaps by this time&mdash;
</p>
<p>What was that moving in the grass?
He had noticed a sort of something
before. He threw up his right hand in
a threatening gesture, to frighten the
intruder away.
</p>
<p>Instantly he got his answer, and an
icy wind seemed to ruff his hair&mdash;that
insistent, dry, shrilling sound that will
make a man&#8217;s blood turn cold if anything
will&mdash;the whirring defiance of a
rattlesnake!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Jim thought quick and hard, with
chills and fever coursing over him <i>ad
libitum</i>. He did not want to waken
and frighten the boy. He managed to
slip his arm out without disturbing the
sleeper. But now! There wasn&#8217;t a
club around except the short sticks of
the fire. A two-foot stick is not the
proper equipment for rattler hunting,
except to those born with nerves so
strong that they do not hesitate to catch
Mr. Crotalus by the tail and snap his
head off.
</p>
<p>Jim thought of the rope he had used
for a cinch, and made for it with his
eye on the snake, lest the latter should
approach closer to the boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>With a deep thankfulness for the
heft of the rope, he returned and struck
with all the strength of his big body,
and pounded away in a sort of crazy
rage, although the first stroke had done
the business.
</p>
<p>He snapped the sweat from his brow
as he looked down at the still writhing
reptile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! What might have happened
if the boy hadn&#8217;t waked me?&#8221; he
thought. The superstition of the miner
rose in him rampant. &#8220;I believe that
kid&#8217;s going to bring me good luck,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Darned if I don&#8217;t. Well, I
could stand some.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He took up the body of the rattler
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
on a stick and heaved it far away, then
lit his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I care for any more
sleep to-night,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Like
Ches, it ain&#8217;t that anything will hurt
me out here, but I&#8217;m everlastingly
scared.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He watched the night out, revelling
in his enjoyment of the mystery of the
coming morning, that phase of the day
which never ceases to be unreal, and
which calls out of the watcher sentiments
and emotions he is a stranger to
for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>The sun hung on the sharp point
of Old Dog-Tooth like a portent, before
he woke the boy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Ches was all amazement for a second;
then he gave a glad cry.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! Yer still here, ain&#8217;t yer? No
pipe in dis.&#8221; He looked all around
him. &#8220;Say! Dis is a reg&#8217;lar teeayter
uf er place, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;Dis is der scene where der villun almost
gits der gent wid der sword, if der
stage mannecher didn&#8217;t send sumun
ter help &#8217;im out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim laughed at the sophisticated infant.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe in the theater
much, then, Ches?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aggh!&#8221; replied Ches. &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t
seven it&#8217;s &#8217;leven on der stage&mdash;but it&#8217;s
mostly craps in der street.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, son, there are such points on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the dice,&#8221; admitted Jim. &#8220;But let&#8217;s
have something to eat and we&#8217;ll feel
better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ches rustled around after sticks in
his funny, angularly active style, singing
a song the while from the gladness
of his heart. It was a merry song, about
mother slowly going down the hectic
path of phthisis pulmonalis, and sister,
who has&mdash;one is led to believe&mdash;taken
to small bottles, small hours and undesirable
companions, refusing to come
home and lift the mortgage which is
shortly to be foreclosed&mdash;all in the narrow
confines of twenty-five verses.
</p>
<p>Jim listened to the inspiriting ditty
in astonishment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

<p>he quoted. &#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, child,&#8221;
he continued, in some irritation,
&#8220;where did you learn that echo of the
morgue?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like &#8217;er?&#8221; asked Ches, in
his turn astonished at such a lack of
taste. &#8220;W&#8217;y, dat&#8217;s er gig in der city&mdash;everybuddy
an&#8217; der ginnies wid der organs
is givin&#8217; dat out all day long.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let &#8217;em,&#8221; commanded Jim.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t introduce it to this part of the
country. As you render it, through the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
nose, and with the wail at the end, it is
a thing to make a strong man lie down
and give up the ghost in sheer disgust.
Ches, does it really make you feel good
to sing it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yessir&mdash;kinder,&#8221; replied Ches hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; thought Jim. &#8220;What a life,
to make a song like that a recreation!&#8221;
Then aloud: &#8220;It&#8217;s bad luck to sing before
breakfast, Ches. I&#8217;ll teach you a
livelier song than that when we hit the
trail again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it came to pass that during the
first miles of their day&#8217;s journey the
way was enlivened by the notes of <i>The
Arkansas Traveler</i>, <i>Garry Owen</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
<i>Where&#8217;s My Linda-Cinda Gone?</i>,
<i>Baltimore Girls</i>, and other songs of a
lively character.
</p>
<p>Ches approved of these in moderation.
Then Jim tried an experiment.
With a serious face, but half an eye on
the boy, he howled, moaned and grunted
<i>The Cow-boy&#8217;s Lament</i>, which
still presents the insoluble problem of
whether the words or the music are
drearier. &#8220;OooooOOO!!! Pla-a-ay
your fifes l-o-o-w-l-y, a-a-nd beee-eat
your drums sl-o-o-o-wly, and play the
dead m-a-arch as you carry me o-o-o-on!&#8221;
mourned Jim. Ches was all attention.
&#8220;For I&#8217;m o-o-o-nly a p-o-o-o-r
cow-boy, and I know I&#8217;ve done
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
w-r-o-o-o-o-o-ng!&#8221; wailed the singer, in conclusion.
&#8220;How&#8217;d you like that, Ches?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, dat&#8217;s a ringer!&#8221; cried the boy
enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>Jim sat him down by the roadside
and laughed his fill. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re
hopeless,&#8221; he gasped.
</p>
<p>The boy was hurt in a way he could
not understand. Something pained
him&mdash;a new sensation, of not being up
to the requirements of another&#8217;s view.
His forced acute intelligence made a
bull&#8217;s-eye shot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;P&#8216;r&#8217;aps w&#8217;en I&#8217;ve got er chist and
t&#8217;umpers on me like you, I&#8217;ll like der
udder kin&#8217; er song,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Jim looked at the pathetic little figure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
on the burro, and his conscience
smote him. &#8220;That&#8217;s right, boy,&#8221; he replied
very kindly. &#8220;I was only joking&mdash;ought
not to be any ill feeling between
friends over a joke, you know.
Now, you sing ahead all you plenty
please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say nuttin&#8217; more about it,&#8221; replied
Ches. &#8220;It&#8217;s all square.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A little farther on Jim noticed a
piece of quartz outcrop with a metal
stain on it. Now, a miner can no more
pass such a thing than some others
could refuse to pick up the pin shining
at their feet, so he took a stone and
hammered off a specimen for future
reference. In the meantime Ches, on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
the burro, got around the turn of the
trail.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the boy set up a shout of
excitement. &#8220;Oh, Mister!&#8221; he yelled,
with a string of profanity, his promise
forgotten in his heat. &#8220;Come quick,
an&#8217; look at der cat! Come quick, quick,
quick! What a cat! You never see
sich a cat!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim dashed forward. &#8220;Well, I
should say cat!&#8221; he remarked, as he
took in the situation. On a ledge about
fifty feet above the road crouched a
full-grown mountain lion, ears back,
eyes furtively glimpsing every avenue
of escape, yaggering at the intruders
savagely.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>The small boy in Jim Felton rose on
the instant. &#8220;Pelt him, Ches! Pelt
him!&#8221; he cried, and let fly the rock in
his hand by way of illustration. A wild
animal seems to have little idea of a
missile.
</p>
<p>The lion held his ground and let
the stone strike him in the side.
Then, with a screech like the vital
principle of forty thousand tom-cat
fights&mdash;a screech that left a sediment in
the ear-drums of the listeners for the
balance of the morning&mdash;he fairly flew
up the straight side of the cliff, followed
by a rain of projectiles.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ches, we oughtn&#8217;t to have done
that,&#8221; said Jim soberly. &#8220;If that fellow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
had been of another mind, he&#8217;d have
made this the warmest day of our
lives.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;y! Will dey fight?&#8221; asked Ches,
his eyes wide open.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will that, son, sometimes,&#8221; replied
Jim. Then he launched into the
tales of wild beast hunts, drifted from
that to the romance of the gold field,
the riches coming in a day&mdash;the whole
glamour of it.
</p>
<p>Never did narrator have more attentive
listener. There was a sort of
white joy in the boy&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ain&#8217;t I glad to git in dis!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Here&#8217;s just wot I been lookin&#8217;
fur.&#8221; Suddenly he struck Jim on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
shoulder with a tightly clenched fist.
&#8220;I made fur youse der first t&#8217;ing&mdash;didn&#8217;t
yer see me? I know me man all
right. Der secont I put me peeps on
yer I ses ter meself, &#8216;Dat feller won&#8217;t
t&#8217;row yer down, Chimmy&#8217;&mdash;ain&#8217;t I
right, hey? Ain&#8217;t I right, Mister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim patted him on the back. &#8220;I
think you&#8217;re right, old man,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything I can for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer don&#8217;t hafter tell me dat&mdash;I
know it,&#8221; replied the boy. A sudden
sob gathered in his throat and choked
him. &#8220;Yer don&#8217;t know wot I been
t&#8217;rough, Mister&mdash;it &#8217;ud laid out many
er big stiff ten times me size. I&#8217;d&mdash;don&#8217;t
youse laugh at me now, becus I&#8217;m only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
a kid&mdash;I&#8217;d give me heart&#8217;s blood fur
youse, s&#8217; help me, I would, now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake hands, pardner,&#8221; said Jim,
his own voice a trifle hoarse. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
do fine together&mdash;I know we will.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

</div>

<p>They crested the last sharp rise,
and looked down upon the little
cabin huddling in the spruces&mdash;an
island of humanity in the beautiful sea
of the wilderness.
</p>
<p>It seemed to Jim as if the small house
brightened in appearance at the return
of its soul; his heart in turn rose with
a home feeling; his belief in the treasure
which lay where the new channel
cut across the old wash&mdash;that treasure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
which would make the world so different&mdash;came
back to him like a renewed
love. His hands ached for a grip on
pick and shovel. His strong muscles
twitched with eagerness to be at work
again.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a ponderous and gross
sound, out of all proportion to the size
of its source, smashed the mountain
silence into slivers. It was the burro&#8217;s
greeting to his companions, and the
echoes fluttered it from cliff to cliff
until it faded into the merest tint.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kerissmus! How many of dem is
dere?&#8221; asked Ches, astonished at the
demonstration. At that instant the herd
welcomed the returned one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>The cañon was full of brays; colliding,
rising, falling and swelling in a
tumult of noise against which the
dreadful shouting of the gods at the
fall of Troy would have seemed as the
wail of a kitten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I don&#8217;t like dat!&#8221; said Ches.
&#8220;What&#8217;s loose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim had watched the growing astonishment
of the boy&#8217;s face with suppressed
emotion, but now he hugged
himself and uproariously laughed his
laugh out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That, Ches,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;is a matter
of fifteen or twenty donkeys and an
echo&mdash;did you think it was the end of
the world?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I t&#8217;ought it was gittin&#8217; on well past
der middle, all right,&#8221; retorted Ches.
&#8220;What &#8217;ud yer expeck of a man dat
never heerd der like before?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew what to expect. I never
heard them either till I came out here.
I was digging a hole up the side of that
hill yonder, and had begun to feel that
there was something behind me, and
that it was almost time to go home,
when old Jack, who has the voice of his
family, poured out his soul about
twenty rods away. I was half way
home, Ches, before I got sand enough
to go back and investigate. But now
listen, and you&#8217;ll hear something prettier
than that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>He put his fingers to his lips and
whistled a bugle call.

<p>sounded Jim. And back came the
pretty reveille in a fabric of music, indescribably
interwoven; sharp and
staccato from the neighboring walls;
the lightest of whispers from the distance,
turning and twisting upon itself
and starting afresh when all seemed
still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, dat <i>is</i> prutty!&#8221; said Ches enthusiastically.
&#8220;Hit her again!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Young man, you can come up here
whenever you feel like it in the future,
but as for now, I&#8217;m for home and
grub.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat ain&#8217;t so bad, neither. Der animile&#8217;s
jumped me up an&#8217; down till I
cud hold more&#8217;n a man. Dis spook&#8217;s
hang-out business won&#8217;t quit, will it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir; that&#8217;s a fixture. Hang on
tight now, and I&#8217;ll race you to the cabin&mdash;one,
two, three!&#8221; and away sprinted
Jim down the hill trail, the burro lumbering
after.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No fair! No fair!&#8221; yelled Ches.
&#8220;Yer&#8217;ve got me skate doped! T&#8217;row
us a tow!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim wheeled at the doorway and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
took in the excited, happy little figure
bumping on the burro&#8217;s back. For once
in his life he had the satisfaction of an
indisputable proof that he had done
well. With a sudden access of affection
he caught the boy in his arms and
stood him on the ground. &#8220;Well, here&#8217;s
our home, Ches,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Home! The street Arab filled his
puny chest, took a long, devouring look
about him, and sought a definition of
the word to make sound the lift of
pride and hope that rose within him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yer mean nobuddy kin chase us
out of dis?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our&#8217;n!&#8221; the boy went on with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
curious vehemence. &#8220;Like dis here,&#8221;
snatching an old knife from his pocket
and shaking it in his tight fist, &#8220;ter
t&#8217;row away, ter sell, er ter keep, and nobuddy
got nuttin&#8217; ter say about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that, laddybuck. That and
nothing else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No more slinkin&#8217; an&#8217; snoopin&#8217;
aroun&#8217; dodgin&#8217; der coppers; no more
stallin&#8217; fer der push; no more dirt of no
kind&mdash;say, I can&#8217;t git dat jus&#8217; in a minute.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stood grappling with the new
idea. In the search an old one came to
the top. His face changed rapidly.
The furtive, hunted look returned. In
a tone, the odd quiet of which contrasted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
with the former heat, he spoke
again. &#8220;Yer for <i>me</i>, now, ain&#8217;t yer,
Jim? If&mdash;if der Gun should happen
ter come here, yer wouldn&#8217;t t&#8217;row me
down at dis stage of der game?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The big man answered him with an
equal soberness. He thrust a hand before
the boy&#8217;s eyes&mdash;a splendid hand,
massive and corded at the base, running
out to long, shapely, intelligent fingers,
and every line in it spoke of power.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that hand, Ches?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yessir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If the &#8216;Gun&#8217; shows his face where
that hand can get a grip on him, it will
do the business for him in one squeeze,
and if the hand can&#8217;t reach, there&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
rifle inside that can. Now get that out
of your mind once for all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221; said the boy, &#8220;well&mdash;aw,
I&#8217;ll be damned, dat&#8217;s all I kin say, Jim,&#8221;
and rushed into the house.
</p>
<p>The miner leaned back and laughed,
and blew his nose; and laughed again
and blew his nose again; then he wiped
the dust out of his eyes, swore a few
words himself, and followed the boy
within.
</p>
<p>The next day Jim started on his work
in earnest. Before, he had sunk a hole
here or there in the broad smooth surface
of the bar of gravel that he felt
certain hid his bonanza.
</p>
<p>Now, he determined to begin at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the creek bank and drift straight across
the bar. That meant six hundred feet
of tunnel at the best, unless fortune was
much kinder than she had hinted at before&mdash;quite
an undertaking for one
man, considering the timbering and all.
</p>
<p>It must have been a miner who
wrote, that hope springs eternal in the
human breast. Surely in no place other
than the mines is the fact so manifest.
There was once a man seventy-three
years old who was sinking through a
cap of cement two hundred feet thick.
The stuff was just this side of powderwork,
barely to be loosened with a
pick. The old man had to climb down
sixty feet of ladder, fill his bucket,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
climb up again and dump it, and so
on and so on and so on. Besides, he had
to walk thirty miles and back again
with his load, whenever he ran out of
provisions. It had taken him a year to
put his shaft down the sixty feet. There
was one hundred and forty more to
go, each foot getting harder, the
Lord only knew what would be at
the bottom when he got there; yet to
sit in that old man&#8217;s cabin for an hour
was to obtain a complete exposition of
the theory and practice of optimism.
It is an unbelievable story and would
be senseless, were it not entirely true.
</p>
<p>Beside that effort, Jim&#8217;s task took on
the tint of an avocation, but the man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
who runs six hundred feet of tunnel
single-handed earns whatever may be
at the end of it.
</p>
<p>The tunnel was the one thing that
Ches abhorred in his new surroundings.
Whether it was that it reminded him of
the dingy holes of his city life, or
whether it was a natural antipathy,
Ches was one of those who can never
enter a confined space without the sensation
of smothering&mdash;at any rate,
neither argument nor coaxing could
get him to put a foot within its dark
mouth.
</p>
<p>An old miner would have shared
his feelings in this instance, for Jim, so
thorough in some things, was a careless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
workman. Your old miner would have
shaken his head at the weak caps and
recklessly driven lagging; frames out
of plumb and made of any stick that
came to hand&mdash;more especially as they
were to support loose dirt of the most
treacherous sort.
</p>
<p>Ches worked outside, dumping the
car that Jim had made of four tree sections
for wheels, and sluice-box boards
for sides. Jim, the ingenious, had
rigged up a pulley system, whereby
Ches could run the car out and in without
interrupting the work on the face.
</p>
<p>It was hard labor for Ches at first,
but he gritted his teeth and stuck it out
manfully.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<span class='caption'>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Bime-by,&#8221; he would say to himself,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have er muscle on me like Jim,
an&#8217; den I&#8217;ll yank dis cussed ol&#8217; car
right out in der middle of der crik,&#8221;
and he examined the small bunch on
his arm critically a dozen times every
day.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his hero and idol was
outdoing the human in his exertions.
The effort he put forth would have
killed an ordinary man. He fought the
stubborn earth as though it were an enemy.
Stripped to the waist, bent over in
the low tunnel, hour after hour Jim
plied the pick and shovel with the regularity
and power of a machine. There
was at once something fascinating and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
heroic in the rippling glide of the muscles
over his broad back, and in the
supple swing that sent the pick to join
the packed dirt.
</p>
<p>It all looked so easy. It was as if
the dirt were very soft, and not the
striker very strong. Nevertheless, fourteen
hours a day of this, varied occasionally
by cutting timbers and carrying
them by hand to the tunnel&mdash;some
of them a weight enough for a horse,
others not adequate, &#8220;just as they came&#8221;
being careless Jim&#8217;s motto&mdash;told even
on his engines.
</p>
<p>They had a certain mark on the
cañon side&mdash;a wild-cat&#8217;s hole it was&mdash;and
when the sun threw the shadow of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
the western wall upon the mark, the
day&#8217;s work was finished.
</p>
<p>Ches used to watch this with attention.
&#8220;Yer move along all right till
yer gits half way up, den yer jus&#8217;
crawls, yer ol&#8217; beggar!&#8221; was his standing
remark on the progress of the shadow.
Still, he always gave good measurement.
</p>
<p>Toward the last of the month Jim
grew an interest in their clock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the blame thing now,
Ches?&#8221; would come hollowly out of the
tunnel.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three more cars away, Jim,&mdash;jus&#8217;
tippin&#8217; the white rock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the cheery shout of &#8220;All over!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
and the worker stepping out into the
fresh air, soft and cool in the twilight,
hooking the sweat from his forehead,
and wishing that supper would cook itself.
Sometimes the wild-cat looked
down upon them from his eyrie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ches,&#8221; said weary Jim, &#8220;if that lad
thinks at all, he must think we&#8217;re awful
fools.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t be so tur&#8217;ble off his
guess, neider,&#8221; replied the equally
weary Ches.
</p>
<p>After supper, however, the world
seemed different. There was Jones&#8217;s
Hill&mdash;(a man of large ideas, was Jones,
to call that mass of rock a hill)&mdash;shining
red-hot in the last light against a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
topaz or turquoise sky, and the gulch
that ran up to it in a mystery of dark
green gloom offering up an evening
prayer of indescribable odors&mdash;those
appeals to a life in former spheres
which no other sense remembers; the
ceaseless roar of the wind in the pines,
so steady that it formed a background
for other sounds almost as good as silence
itself; the evening pipe, and the
talk of what had been done and what
was to be done&mdash;all these made amends.
</p>
<p>And then the sleeping&mdash;such sleeping!
And waking up in the morning in
the exact attitude one went to sleep the
night before! Sleep that washed out all
the former day&#8217;s fatigue, and started
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
them as eager as hounds for that of the
new day. That is, within limits, for,
when a man overworks as continually
as Jim had done, no paradise sleep nor
balsam air can turn him right perpetually.
</p>
<p>And for that reason the claim declared
a holiday, consisting of a hunting
trip. It was a curious hunting trip.
Not one &#8220;bang!&#8221; went the clean and
polished rifle. They stalked four deer,
crawling on their bellies, quivering
with the chase, rounding behind rocks.
Then when the game was within range,
up went the rifle, Jim squinted along
the sights&mdash;then dropped it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s der matter?&#8221; whispered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Ches. He had been waiting for a long
time to hear the gun go off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to be having a pretty
good time by themselves there, Ches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;dat&#8217;s so&mdash;but I&#8217;ve heard deer-meat
was good.&#8221; Ches was disappointed
at this manner of hunting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is,&#8221; replied Jim, &#8220;probably
nobody has that notion stronger than
the deer.&#8221; He followed the four pretty
animals below them with tense eyes.
He loved to hunt but he hated to kill.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, boy,&#8221; he said, sitting down
and pulling off his boots, &#8220;I think I can
show you some fun&mdash;do you notice
they&#8217;re feeding up to that nose of rock?
Well I used to be rather quick on my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
feet once, and I think if I can slip down
behind there without their winding me,
if one gets close enough I can catch him
with my hands&mdash;which is a trick I&#8217;d
like muchly to accomplish. Now you
sit here and watch, and for your life,
don&#8217;t make a move or sound! By
Jiminy! if I could do that!&#8221; He trotted
light-footed down the slope out of
sight.
</p>
<p>The boy soon saw him reappear behind
the sharp rock-wall that jutted
out into the valley, rubbing crushed
pine-needles upon himself with the
idea of overpowering the human odor,
although, whether effective in its purpose
or not, it was not necessary&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
strong up-wind from deer to man making
it impossible that they could scent
him.
</p>
<p>They waited and they waited, a big
man crouched like a tiger below, and a
highly excited small boy above, while
the deer did every exasperating thing
that animals could do.
</p>
<p>They started straight for the rock,
grazing along, and then for no reason
in the world beat back on their tracks,
or turned to right or left. They even
went so far as to lie down, chewing
most contentedly.
</p>
<p>One hour went by&mdash;two&mdash;when suddenly
the buck rose and walked straight
up the cañon in a course that would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
take him within twenty feet of the rock.
Jim heard him snort and prepared for
action, laying hold of a corner of stone
to get a spring from all-fours.
</p>
<p>The deer&#8217;s shadow floated black on
the grass before him, and Jim leaped&mdash;to
the biggest surprise of his life, for
instead of making the least effort to escape,
the buck charged, and that with
such sudden fury it was all the man
could do to lay hold of him anywhere
as they came to dirt together.
</p>
<p>The next ten seconds was delirium,
each combatant doing something as
quick as he could without any definite
aim. Jim received a painful rake
across the chest from the antlers, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
a jab in the leg from the sharp hoofs,
while the deer was the worse for several
bangs over the head and an ear
nearly pulled off, as they rolled over
together.
</p>
<p>It came over Jim with the force of
a revelation that he had got into a very
different business from that which he
had intended. Instead of the &#8220;timid
deer&#8221; whose capture was the difficulty,
he found himself engaged with a
horned and hoofed demon, and the
problem was how to get away.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ches had legged it down
the hill-side at his best speed, enthusiastically
cheering what he supposed
was a prearranged performance. Jim
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
had promised him fun, and that whirling
heap below supplied plenty of it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; yelled Ches. &#8220;Hooray!
Hold him dere, Jim, till I get down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim heard the shrill voice, as he succeeded,
after a desperate effort, in getting
an arm around the deer&#8217;s neck, so
that he could do something in the choking
line, and he smiled grimly in the
heat of battle. &#8220;All right, Ches!&#8221; he
gasped. &#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;hurry!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep out of this!&#8221; he yelled a moment
later as Ches burst out from the
bushes. &#8220;You&#8217;ll get killed!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Ches was not to be denied. He
danced around the pushing, tugging,
straining storm-center, and the moment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
opportunity offered, slipped in and
seized the buck by a hind leg.
</p>
<p>If he had touched an electric battery,
the effect could not have been more instant.
The deer fanned that muscular
hind leg, with its boy attachment, at the
rate of seven hundred strokes to the
minute. Poor Ches&#8217; head was nearly
snapped off his shoulders, and the
breath was literally jerked out of his
body, but he hung on, with all the
strength that pulling the car had given
him.
</p>
<p>It was not much help, but it was a
diversion. Jim gulped a lungful of
air, gathered his powers and came
down with all his might. Slowly the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
stubborn neck, bent&mdash;so slowly that Jim
feared he would give out before gaining
the mastery. As it yielded, his leverage
increased, and at last, exerting
every ounce of strength that was in
him, he downed the foe and held him
there, his leg over the front legs whose
armament he had felt before, and was
not desirous of feeling again.
</p>
<p>But the deer gave up the struggle,
and lay quiet, looking up with great
pleading eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you devil!&#8221; cried Jim, &#8220;you
look meek enough now, but if you
weren&#8217;t a handful of hard luck ten seconds
ago I never ran across one. You
hurt, Ches?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I got a lovely t&#8217;ump on me smeller,
but I&#8217;m in it yet&mdash;do I let go or don&#8217;t
I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life&mdash;wait a moment!&#8221;
He worked his weight over on the
deer&#8217;s body. &#8220;Now!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Quick!
Jump loose!&#8221; Again the deer glanced
up reproachfully, as though to say,
&#8220;How suspicious you are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The instant Ches jumped clear, so
did Jim. They watched their late antagonist,
who sprang to his feet and
went off with frisky leaps, apparently
as fresh as ever.
</p>
<p>Then they looked at each other. Ches
was rubbing his stomach with his left
hand, while he wiped the blood from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
his nose with the right. Jim&#8217;s coat and
trousers were torn; he had a deep
scratch across his chest, a gouge in his
leg, and he trembled from the exertion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;Ches!&#8221; he panted, &#8220;we&#8217;ve&mdash;had&mdash;a&mdash;nice&mdash;rest&mdash;haven&#8217;t
we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it &#8216;a&#8217; been tur&#8217;ble if yer
hadn&#8217;t caught him?&#8221; replied Ches.
And then they simply whooped.
</p>
<p>A good incident is an opal among
gems in a lonely life. You can turn it
over and over and always get new colors.
</p>
<p>On the home trip, as Nimrod Jim
stalked along with his follower trotting
beside, they rehearsed every detail
of the unexpected encounter. Jim
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
crouched and leaped again, giving his
sensations when the buck did likewise.
Then he waited while Ches ran down
a side hill and threw himself upon a
sapling, which for the time was a deer&#8217;s
hind leg.
</p>
<p>They were just of an age&mdash;any one
would have said so, on seeing them approach
the cabin, arms flying, tongues
wagging, bruised, tired and happy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said a very sleepy little boy
after supper, gorged like an anaconda,
&#8220;yer don&#8217;t see t&#8217;ings like dat in N&#8217;york&mdash;not
much yer don&#8217;t. If dat racket
had come off in der Bowery, dere&#8217;d be
head-lines&mdash;&#8217;dlines&mdash;on der extries&mdash;more&#8217;n
a mile&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>Jim picked him up and tucked him
into his bunk. &#8220;More&#8217;n a mile long&mdash;g&#8217;
nigh&#8217;,&#8221; sighed Ches.
</p>
<p>Jim lit his pipe and went out for an
evening smoke. It was some little time
the next morning before he could realize
what he was doing out there under
the tree.
</p>
<p>He had been in some ways a graver
man of late. What he had undertaken
as an experiment, a generous impulse,
had been turned into a lasting responsibility.

<h2>IV</h2>
</div>

<p>On the second day after Ches&#8217; arrival,
Bud had come through
with the mail, and before leaving, drew
Jim aside, out of the boy&#8217;s hearing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The little feller&#8217;s yours agin all
comers now, Jim,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Jim, surprised
by the meaning in the tone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s <i>yours</i>,&#8221; repeated Bud. &#8220;That
sweet-scented blossom that called himself
the boy&#8217;s dad, filled his skin with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
red-eye farther up the line and settled
the fuss he had with his dame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Man!&#8221; said Bud slowly, &#8220;he used
a knife a foot long&mdash;gave it to her a
dozen times as hard as he could drive&mdash;what&#8217;s
your opinion?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord Almighty! Did he get away?
But no, of course he couldn&#8217;t, being on
the train&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t get away. The Con.
wired the news to Kimballs. What was
he to do when a small army of punchers
boarded the train and took the prisoner?
He couldn&#8217;t do nothing, and he
never loved that black-muzzled whelp
from the time he sassed him in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
depot. The punchers took our friend
out and tried him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tried him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;With a rope. In three minutes by;
the watch he was found wanting&mdash;your
boy now, Jim, as I was telling you.
Going to say anything to him about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Jim, bewildered, &#8220;why,
I don&#8217;t know, Bud&mdash;guess not, just yet,
on general principles. What do you
think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Bud.
&#8220;The poor little rooster couldn&#8217;t help
but feel glad to hear the news, but it
would sound kind of awful to hear a
kid like that say he was glad two
people were killed. Better wait till he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
been with you a while, Jim, and learned
something different.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jim flushed at the implied compliment.
&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Bud, I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Great little papoose, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;
said Bud, turning in his saddle before
his starting rush. &#8220;Makings of a man
there, all right. The boys in town are
dead stuck on him. I&#8217;ll have to give a
complete history when I get back. I
must get a gait on, or I&#8217;ll have Uncle
Sammy on my neck again&mdash;inspector
started out with me this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil he did!&#8221; cried Jim indignantly,
well knowing the hardships and
dangers of the big rider&#8217;s route.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right!&#8221; replied Bud with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
a wave of his hand. &#8220;Come out fine.
When the lad first told me he&#8217;d been
sent out to see why the mails was so late
on this line, I told him I&#8217;d show him
right on the spot, but he said there was
no use getting hot about it, as he was
only doing his duty, so I quieted down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a decent sort of feller. I
thought to myself before we got under
way, &#8216;Now, there won&#8217;t nothing happen
this day&mdash;everything&#8217;ll go as
smooth and slick as grease, and this
feller will report that I&#8217;m sojering,&#8217;
that&#8217;s the way it usually works, you
know. But this time I played in luck.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two miles out of town we ran into
a wild-eyed gang from somewhere,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
who was going to make us dance. We
didn&#8217;t dance, and I&#8217;ll say for that inspector
that he stood by me like a man,
but he was awful sick at his stomach
later on from the excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Next thing, the bridge was down at
Squaw Creek, and we swum her. He&#8217;d
have gone down the flume, if I hadn&#8217;t
got hold of his bridle. &#8216;Nice mail route,
this,&#8217; says he, as he got ashore. &#8216;Oh,
you&#8217;d like it,&#8217; says I, &#8216;if you got used to
it.&#8217; I&#8217;d begun to wonder what was next
myself. Ain&#8217;t many people swimming
Squaw Creek, as you perhaps know.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, next was about ten mile along,
just before you come to the old Tin-cup
Camp. We was passing the bluff there,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
and all of a sudden, rip, thump, biff!
Down comes what looked like the
whole side a-top of us. It weren&#8217;t
though. It was only a cinnamon had
lost his balance, leaning over too far to
see what we was. That bear landed
right agin brother inspector&#8217;s horse,
and brother inspector&#8217;s horse tried to
climb a tree. Inspector himself fell
a-top of the bear. I dassent shoot, for
the devil himself couldn&#8217;t have told
which was inspector and which bear.
Finally bear shakes himself loose and
telescopes himself up the cañon, the
worst scared animile in the country.
&#8216;If you&#8217;ll ketch my horse, I&#8217;ll amble
back again,&#8217; says the inspector. &#8216;I&#8217;ve investigated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
this route pretty thorough,
and find it&#8217;s just as you say. Lamp-posts&#8217;ll
do me all right for a while.&#8217;
Come out fine, didn&#8217;t it?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whish there! Untie yourself, you
yaller bone-heap!&#8221; And the mail was
a quarter of a mile up the trail.
</p>
<p>Jim pondered the information concerning
Ches carefully, only to adhere
to his original determination. He
could not see any way in which the boy
would be benefited by hearing the news.
Still, the miner hated anything that
savored of concealment or deception.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Anne was here to help me,&#8221;
he thought; &#8220;she&#8217;d know what to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sat long, looking down, his hands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
clasped about his knees, drinking with
old Tantalus. But the reverie ended
as it always did&mdash;in action. There was
nothing for it but the claim. Success
there meant success everywhere.
</p>
<p>It was the knowledge that Anne, the
boy, and all he wished to do for both
depended on the pay-streak which had
urged him to such a fury of effort.
</p>
<p>His carelessness of his own life, that
led him to slap his timbering up any
way, was born of that same fury. And
the consequences came like most consequences,
without a moment&#8217;s warning.
</p>
<p>It was a still and beautiful noon.
Ches had pulled out the last car before
dinner, and started for the cabin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>A curious groaning and snapping
from the tunnel halted him. It was the
giving of the tortured timbers. On the
heels of that came a dull, crushing roar.
A blast of dust shot from the tunnel-mouth,
like smoke from a cannon, preceded
by a shock that nearly threw the
boy off his feet.
</p>
<p>Then all was still again. The sun
shone as brilliantly as before, blazing
down upon the ghastly face of a little
boy, who, after one heart-broken cry of
&#8220;Jim! Oh, Jim&#8217;s killed!&#8221; sank down
upon the ground, chewing the fingers
thrust in his mouth, that the pain might
make the black wave keep its distance.
</p>
<p>For Ches knew that he was alone;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
that there was no human being within
miles to help the man caught in the
hand of that mischance but himself, so
frantically willing, but so impotent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must git me wits tergedder&mdash;I
must!&#8221; and down came the teeth with
all the strength of the boy&#8217;s jaw. &#8220;Oh,
what will I do? What will I do?&#8221; The
little head waved from side to side in
its agony, and a sudden sob struck him
in the throat.
</p>
<p>After that one small weakness rose
Ches Felton, hero. To the mouth of the
tunnel he went. Above the tumbled
pile of dirt and timber ran a sort of
passage, between it and the roof.
</p>
<p>A way along which a boy might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
crawl and find out if all the frames
were down&mdash;to which the silence of the
tunnel gave a bitter assent&mdash;or if
by some most lucky chance one or
two had held, and Jim be safe within.
</p>
<p>Ches climbed to the top and thrust
his head into the gloom. &#8220;Jim!&#8221; he
called, &#8220;Jim!&#8221; No answer.
</p>
<p>Before him lay the ruin of his pardner&#8217;s
work. It was over this that his
path lay, as deadly dangerous a path as
could be found. The slightest disturbing
of the roof above might bring down
a thousand tons of dirt upon the one
who ventured, slowly and hideously to
crush his life out, there in the dark, beyond
sight and sound of the cheerful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
world without. With this knowledge
before him, and his inborn fear of the
dark hole, as daunting as the hand of
death itself, he took his soul in his
gripe, and wormed his way within.
</p>
<p>Sometimes his back grazed a stone
in the roof, and the touch of white-hot
iron could not have been so terrible;
sometimes a falling stone near him
would make his heart leap and stop as
he waited for the hill above to follow.
Foot by foot he made it, twisting
around the end of a post, scooping out
the dirt most cautiously where the hole
was too small for even his slight body.
</p>
<p>Once the sharp end of a broken piece
of lagging caught in his clothes, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
could go neither forward nor back.
There, for a second, he broke down.
Bracing up again, he managed somehow
to get the old knife out of his
pocket and cut himself free.
</p>
<p>He could see little.
</p>
<p>A gray spectral light filtered in here
and there that defined nothing, even
when his eyes grew accustomed to the
darkness.
</p>
<p>It was an endless journey. In places
where the dirt closed in he would be
a full minute progressing a foot, and a
minute of such mortal terror as seldom
falls to the lot of man of peace or soldier.
</p>
<p>But it ended.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>Suddenly the boy&#8217;s outstretched
hand encountered only emptiness below.
That frame had held. He dove
into the space head first, and landed on
something soft and warm&mdash;the body of
his pardner.
</p>
<p>He had found him. In a paroxysm
of joy, he flung himself upon the motionless
figure and cried his heart out.
This, too, he soon conquered. Jim had
just so much show&mdash;any delay might
wipe it out. He searched the man&#8217;s
pockets until he found a match. By its
light he saw the candle stuck into the
post, and lit it. Then he knelt beside his
pardner again.
</p>
<p>It was a curious picture within that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
gloomy chamber underground. The
miner lying stark, stretched to his full
great length, appearing enormous in
the flickering candle-light, and the
child, white-faced, big-eyed, but steady
as a veteran, wiping the blood from the
ragged cut in the man&#8217;s head.
</p>
<p>Ches realized what had happened
the instant before the calamity. Jim,
startled by the noise of the yielding timbers,
had made a rush, only to be struck
down by the rock, that now lay within
an inch of him; yet struck into safety
for all that. Had he gone a yard farther,
the life would have been smashed
out of him instantly.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-118.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<p>But now, what? The flowing blood
sent a sickening chill through the boy.
Had he done this much only to be able
to see his pardner die? He drove his
teeth into his hand again at the thought.
What was that? Was it a trick of the
tunnel, his heart sounding in his own
ears, or a rhythmic beat from outside?
Hollow and dull fell that &#8220;clatter-clum-clatter-clum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bud!&#8221; screamed Ches, &#8220;T&#8217;ank God,
dat&#8217;s Bud!&#8221;
</p>
<p>After half a dozen efforts he climbed
the dirt pile and went back through the
treacherous holes. The rider came so
fast! &#8220;Oh!&#8221; groaned the boy, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never make it! Bud&#8217;ll t&#8217;ink we&#8217;re off
somewheres an&#8217; pull on!&mdash;<i>Bud</i>! BUD!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
he called at the top of his lungs;
but the tunnel swallowed the little
voice.
</p>
<p>Desperation made him entirely reckless.
It was any way to get out before
the mail-man was beyond call.
Glairy with sweat, he pulled, tugged,
squirmed and wriggled along, until a
dirty, small bundle rolled down almost
under the mail-rider&#8217;s feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa!&#8221; shouted Bud with an astonished
oath. &#8220;What&#8217;s the&mdash;why boy,
what&#8217;s the matter? Damn it! how you
scart me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>One look at him froze the man; he
said no more, but waited, watching the
working face of the child, who was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
mastering himself once more, in order
to tell a quick, straight story, that no
time might be lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Der tunnel&#8217;s fell in, Bud; Jim&#8217;s in
dere where der frame&#8217;s held. He&#8217;s livin&#8217;
yet, but he&#8217;s got a tur&#8217;ble cut in his
head.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The mail-rider drew out paper and
tobacco, and rolled a cigarette. It was
his method of biting his hand. He
loved the man inside that dark blotch
on the hill-side with an affection only
known where men are few and strong.
And because he loved him, Bud was
going to keep his head cool and clear,
to find the right thing to do and do it
the right way.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>For all his calm outer man the
mind within was whirling. He turned
to the tense little face before him for
help, and with an admiration that
knew no bounds.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far back?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217;ree frames was held&mdash;dere was
seven, ten foot apart&mdash;how much is
dat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty feet&mdash;ten foot apart! No
wonder! Oh, Jim! How could you
have been so careless?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s shoulders shook once. &#8220;He
worked like er horse&mdash;now it&#8217;s all gone
an&#8217; he&#8217;s in dere&mdash;&#8221; The face was contorted
out of all humanity, but he held
the tears back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>Bud leaped from his horse. &#8220;Never
you mind, Chessy lad!&#8221; he cried, hugging
up the little figure, &#8220;we&#8217;ll get him
out of that, by God!&mdash;Could we haul
him out the way you went?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dere ain&#8217;t room&mdash;an&#8217; if you
touch dat roof hard&mdash;&#8221; he shuddered.
</p>
<p>Bud sucked in his breath. &#8220;If you
weren&#8217;t the sandy little man to try it!&#8221;
he said. He stood a moment in silence
going over it all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ches,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t any
time to lose. If Jim&#8217;s cut like that he
may bleed to death in there when we
could save him all right if we had him
outside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a party of miners down the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
road eight mile. They was having their
grub as I went by. Chances are they&#8217;ll
be there yet. They&#8217;ve got four men
and a team. I <i>could</i> ride back, but I
ought to be here working. Do you
think you could stick on old Buck and
ride there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I kin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By God! I hate to do it&mdash;but there
ain&#8217;t any other way!&#8221; The big man
ground his teeth together. &#8220;I hate to
do it&mdash;damned if I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ches caught his hand. &#8220;I kin make
it, Bud,&#8221; he pleaded; &#8220;I cuddent do
nothin&#8217; if I stayed here, an&#8217; you could
do a heap. Put me up and let me try.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bud. &#8220;The good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
Lord kept you from getting hurt in the
tunnel, perhaps He&#8217;ll see you through
again. Shut your eyes and hold on tight
when you strike the high places, and
don&#8217;t touch a rein&mdash;leave it all to old
Buck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He stepped forward and caught the
horse by the bit.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Buck!&#8221; he said, as though talking
to a human being, &#8220;you and me have
been through a heap together&mdash;don&#8217;t
fall down on me, now!&mdash;Take the kid
safe, old boy!&#8221; He caught Ches up
and threw him across the saddle.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll only have to tell &#8217;em what&#8217;s
happened&mdash;the Lord send nothing
happens to you! Good-by, you brave
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
little devil&mdash;we&#8217;ll win out yet. Go it,
Buck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>And while one of Jim&#8217;s friends plied
pick and shovel like a mad man, the
other was swaying on top of a galloping
horse, gripping the pommel of the
saddle with all the strength he had, and
shutting his eyes when he came to the
high places.
</p>
<p>Captain Hanrahan&#8217;s party were miners
of substance. They were working
their way out to a new country to suit
their inclinations. It had just been
suggested that it was perhaps time to
hit the trail again when the captain saw
a figure on a horse flying athwart the
mountain side&mdash;the regular road was
bad enough, but Bud had short cuts of
his own, and Buck followed his usual
way.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-126.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>

<br />
</span>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;that man&#8217;s
drunk or crazy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy sufferin&#8217;!&#8221; gasped the man
next him, as the yellow horse slipped
on a turn and sent a shower of gravel a
thousand feet below. &#8220;That was a near
touch,&#8221; as the horse caught himself and
swept on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me like a case of trouble,
Cap,&#8221; said a third speaker. &#8220;That ain&#8217;t
no man, anyhow&mdash;it&#8217;s only a boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Horse running away with him,
probably&mdash;his folks ought to be
clubbed for letting him out on such an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
animal. Well, spread out, boys, and
we&#8217;ll catch him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Buck stopped in two jumps, at
Ches&#8217; command of &#8220;Whoa!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fren&#8217;s!&#8221; cried the boy, &#8220;me pardner&#8217;s
caught in a tunnel dat caved in on
him. Kin yer help us out? Three mile
above Jones&#8217;s Hill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He had not finished the sentence before
two men sprang for the horses.
The rest grabbed picks and shovels and
hurled them into the wagon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there, hell-a-whooping,&#8221;
said Captain Hanrahan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;T&#8217;anks!&#8221; replied Ches weakly, and
then the world went out. The captain
caught him as he fell.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little cuss! He rid hard to
help his pardner!&#8221; said the captain.
&#8220;Hump yourselves, boys&mdash;all ready!
Got the whisky, Pete? Picks enough?
Stick the axes where they won&#8217;t jump
loose and cut a leg off some of us. Tie
the horse behind&mdash;good animal, that.
All right, let &#8217;em go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They went. Over stones and gulleys,
the tools clanging and banging fit to
leap from the wagon, the men clinging
to the side-boards for dear life.
</p>
<p>Down hill-sides like the slant of a
roof, the horses keeping out of the way
of the wagon; up the other side with
the reeking animals straining every
fiber; over bridges that bent fearfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
beneath the shock of their onset; swaying
around curves with the wheels sluing
and sparks flying, and over the
level as though the devil himself were
behind them.
</p>
<p>It was the record trip for eight
miles in a wagon in that country. The
driver stood up, a foot braced on either
side, the reins thrown loose, the whip
plied hard, and every urging that voice
could give shrieked out by his powerful
lungs.
</p>
<p>It was like the rush of a fire-engine,
plus twice the speed, and twenty times
the danger. Above the pounding of
hoofs, the din of rattling metal, the
crash, smash and roar of the wheels
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
and the yells of the driver could be
heard the man Pete, ex-cowpuncher,
cheerfully singing,
</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin: 0 auto 0 ; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Roll your tails, and roll &#8217;em high,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>We&#8217;ll all be angels by-and-by.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Braced in the back corner sat Captain
Hanrahan, his leg keeping some
of the tools from going overboard,
holding Ches in his arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse it all, Billy!&#8221; he screamed to
the driver, &#8220;miss <i>some</i> of them bumps,
will you? I&#8217;ve got on a new pair of
pants.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take &#8217;em clean off you the next
time, Cap!&#8221; retorted the driver.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>They joked, which may seem heartless;
but they risked their necks a hundred
times, and that isn&#8217;t very heartless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the place, I reckon, Cap!&#8221;
said the driver, pointing. &#8220;Somebody
working there now!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em a hoot!&#8221; replied the captain.
</p>
<p>Bud stepped out and held up his
hand in answer to the yell. The wave
of thanksgiving at the sight of this
most efficient help took all the stiffness
out of the knees of the mail-rider. The
tears rolled down his face unnoticed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome, boys,&#8221; he cried,
as the driver sawed the frenzied team
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
to a standstill and the men sprang out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon we are,&#8221; said the captain.
&#8220;Now what&#8217;s up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the boy hurt? Good God! He
ain&#8217;t hurt himself, has he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw; pore little cuss is used up,
that&#8217;s all. He&#8217;ll be around all right in
a minute. Now tell me, what&#8217;s loose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bud answered briefly, but completely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pete and Billy, get to cutting wood&mdash;the
rest of you come here,&#8221; commanded
the captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t going to stop to timber,
are you?&#8221; asked Bud in an agony of
haste.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure am,&#8221; replied the captain.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
&#8220;All this trouble&#8217;s come of carelessness.
Now you just keep your clothes on, and
let me run this thing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have your friend out in no
time, and there won&#8217;t be no more men
stuck in there with a hill a-top of &#8217;em
in the doing of it. What you&#8217;ve done
there is a help all right, but it might
easy have meant that we&#8217;d had two men
instead of one to hunt for.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re dead right,&#8221; said Bud.
&#8220;Tell me what I&#8217;m to do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The captain took hold as only a man
can who has the genius for it. He knew
by long practice what size of a relief
tunnel meant real speed of progress&mdash;the
least dirt to be removed to make it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
possible that men could work to advantage.
And his tunnel, safely rough-ceiled,
went in at the rate of a foot a
minute.
</p>
<p>When at last they pulled the insensible
man out into the light of day,
and found that while his wound,
though severe, and if neglected mortal,
was not likely to be dangerous with
good attention, the captain said that he
must be getting about his business.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stay a little longer, fellers, till
he comes to,&#8221; remonstrated Bud. &#8220;He&#8217;d
like to have a chance to say &#8216;Thank
you.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bugs!&#8221; replied the captain. &#8220;You
tell him he owes us a drink, and as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
particular favor to me, please not to
put his frames over four foot apart in
that ground.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re likely to be back here shortly,
anyhow, because I think your friend
has got hold of the right idea from
what you tell me of his plans; but it&#8217;ll
take more&#8217;n one man to really prospect
it. If we don&#8217;t hit it where we&#8217;re going,
we&#8217;ll sure come back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys, <i>I</i> can thank you and
I&#8217;m going to,&#8221; said Bud. &#8220;That man is
my friend, and if you hadn&#8217;t come as
you did&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, let go,&#8221; interrupted the captain.
&#8220;You&#8217;d have done the same thing
if you&#8217;d been us, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Bud reluctantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you wouldn&#8217;t want to be
thanked for it a white chip more&#8217;n we
do,&#8221; concluded the captain. &#8220;If there&#8217;s
any thanks coming it is to that little
two-foot chunk of man yonder. Snaking
over that fall was a thing to put a
crimp in anybody. You was bound to
help your pardner, wasn&#8217;t you, son?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy looked up into the captain&#8217;s
eagle face. &#8220;I&#8217;d &#8217;er got to Jim,&#8221; he answered
simply, &#8220;&#8217;f I&#8217;d had ter chew
me way in like a rat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The captain stepped back and
looked at him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;By the Lord!&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;I believe
you would!&#8221; A change came over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
the thin, arrogant face. He stooped
suddenly, raised the boy and kissed
him. &#8220;Now, get out o&#8217; this!&#8221; he roared
at the driver, as he leaped into the
wagon.
</p>
<p>They waved their hands as long as
the miners were in sight, and stood
staring until Pete&#8217;s statement that
they&#8217;d all be angels by-and-by was lost
in the distance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty good folks when you&#8217;re in
trouble, ain&#8217;t they, Ches?&#8221; said Bud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What &#8217;ud we have done, if dey
hadn&#8217;t come?&mdash;Ain&#8217;t it &#8217;mos&#8217; time Jim
was moving, Bud?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give him another spoonful of
whisky, but you can&#8217;t expect him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
start right up and hop around. He got
an awful crack, boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For all that, as the dose of strong
liquor went down Jim&#8217;s throat, he
opened his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Bud! Hello, Ches!&#8221; he said
wonderingly. &#8220;Have I been asleep?&mdash;Why,
what the devil&#8217;s the matter with
my head?&#8221; he raised his hand to the
spruce-gum bandage. &#8220;Phew! But I
feel weak!&#8221; he sighed as his hand
dropped. &#8220;Something&#8217;s happened&mdash;what
is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There, with a friend on each side
holding a hand, they told him the story.
It was a sacred reunion.
</p>
<p>The gratitude of the man saved, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the protestations of the others that they
would have done all they did a thousand
times again would only seem
childish in repetition. They cried,
too, which is excusable in a child, but
not in two big men. Men don&#8217;t cry. It
is the monopoly of women. Nevertheless,
Bud and Jim and Ches cried and
swore, and shook hands and cried again
until it was a pitiful thing to see.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bud at last, &#8220;this
makes you feel better, but it won&#8217;t get
the work done. I&#8217;ve got to go out and
fix old Buck and get in some firewood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll do that!&#8221; cried Jim, raising
himself on his elbow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; jeered Bud. &#8220;You look like
it! Now, you lie right down there and
get well&mdash;that&#8217;s your play. It would
make us feel as if we&#8217;d wasted our time
if we had to turn to and bury you after
all the trouble we&#8217;ve had. You&#8217;re good
for two weeks in that bunk, old horse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two weeks! I can&#8217;t, Bud; I can&#8217;t!
I must get up before that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie down there&mdash;hear me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll have to see to things around&mdash;you
can&#8217;t stay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I stay right here till you&#8217;re well.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the mail?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil take the mail&mdash;or anybody
else that wants the job. Uncle
Sammy won&#8217;t hop on to my collar button,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
because of the fine send-off my
friend the inspector&#8217;ll give. And somebody
will get orry-eyed up in town, and
come down to find what&#8217;s loose. He&#8217;ll
take the bags then. It&#8217;s all settled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are other things&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em rest. Now I&#8217;m off to do the
chores&mdash;oh, say, speaking of mail,
here&#8217;s a letter for you I forgot all about
in the excitement&mdash;here you go. Come
along, Ches, and help me carry wood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The miner looked at the letter in his
hand, and a tinge of blood crept into
his white cheeks, then ebbed, leaving
them whiter than before.
</p>
<p>Suppose there were other men who
wanted her; men with money, learning,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
wit and influence. Was this bitterest
of blows to fall upon him when
he was already down? He looked at
his hands, green from loss of blood. &#8220;I
tried,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;I tried.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still the very touch of the paper
seemed to have something warm and
heartening in it. It was from <i>her</i>, anyhow.
With sudden strength he tore it
open and read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dearest, Dearest Jim</span>&mdash;I yield the
whole case. You are right.
</p>
<p>It is to my shame that clear-sightedness
came from no source within me,
but from a brave example set.
</p>
<p>My little cousin married the man
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
she loved last week, and, of course,
Miss Anne was a high functionary.
</p>
<p>Oh, what a stirring there was in me,
Jim, watching them and thinking of
you!
</p>
<p>They will be as poor as church mice,
but they do not care, and theirs is the
wise economy.
</p>
<p>Life is too short to waste, Jim, I see
it now. I put it all in your hands, dearest;
if you can not come to me, I shall
come to you.
</p>
<p>I believe I&#8217;m only lukewarm by
habit, not by nature.
</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you how sorry I
am for the time I have squandered.
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll show you, that will be better.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Any time, or any place and no conditions
now, Jim. That&#8217;s all, my dear
brave lover. Good night.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right'>Your own,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Anne.</span></p>

<p>He was sitting bolt upright. Once
more he devoured the letter. Then he
sank back and closed his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, my darling, I can rest
now,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>The golden sunset light played in
riotous joyousness on the cabin walls;
the little creek laughed out loud; so did
Ches and Bud, approaching the cabin.
It was a beautiful and happy world.
